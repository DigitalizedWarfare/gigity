# Gigity System Launcher 1.0<br />
Descption : I wrote this script to always keep my Stress testing tools Close by. <br />
This system will download and install LOIC and SlowLoris into Kali Linux...<br />
This should also work in most debian based installs.<br /><br />I removed other DDoS tools and 
set a limit to 5 in the gigity script. Please use carefully.
