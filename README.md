# Gigity System Launcher 1.0<br />
Descption : I wrote this script to always keep my Stress testing tools Close by. 
This system will download and install LOIC and SlowLoris into Kali Linux...
This should also work in most debian based installs.<br /><br />I removed other DDoS tools and 
set a limit to 5 in the gigity script. Please use carefully.
